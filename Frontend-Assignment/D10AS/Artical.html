            <h4 class="h51 width">We asked a professional comedian to deliver some jokes written by artificial intelligence on stage. What happened reveals a lot about just how much machines understand the very human sense of humour.</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">Karen Hobbs was more nervous than usual before this particular gig. A <u><b>well-known circuit comedian</b></u>, she's accustomed to the UK's often bruising <u><b>stand-up comedy scene</b></u>. It's eclectic, unpredictable and famously short on pity-laughs. Hobbs has tackled some of the most unforgiving rooms in Britain, from major London theatres to the back rooms of rural pubs. She has even triumphed within the dreaded competition circuit, in which a merciless audience votes in a gladiatorial popularity contest for the funniest gags.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">But this Thursday night in late June, above the Covent Garden Social Club bar in Central London, Hobbs was about to attempt something totally new. She would take to the stage equipped not with her usual material, but with a stand-up set written for her by the AI platform ChatGPT. Most daunting of all, she would follow three comedians doing their actual, human material.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">In the space of two years, the <u><b>OpenAI-developed</b></u> chatbot has gone from a niche, techy curiosity to the first tool to truly bring AI to the masses. As AI entered the mainstream, its already <u><b>terrorised teachers and universities</b></u>, stolen <u><b>jobs from freelance copywriter</b></u>s and even flooded social media with <u><b>low-effort and sometimes unsettling content</b></u>. Some experts warn of a <u><b>potential AI-driven apocalypse</b></u> as machines improve to the point they can truly outperform human beings, a hypothetical technology known as "artificial general intelligence" (AGI). <u><b>Others doubt AI</b></u> will ever even approach that point.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">But when it comes to art, it's debatable whether or not <u><b>generative AI</b></u>, by its nature, can be truly creative. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT work by processing billions of lines of text scraped from the internet and other sources, unpacking the patterns and relationships between words and sentences. Using that data, AI generates responses that are, statistically, the most likely answer to a given prompt. That means these AI tools can only replicate information that already exists in some form, though it can result in never-before-seen combinations of ideas. Whether that counts as creativity is a philosophical question, one currently without a satisfying answer.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="width h511">Can a robot be funny?</h3>
            <p class="h51 width">To understand whether AI tools can really demonstrate humour, Alison Powell, an associate professor of communications at the London School of Economics who studies AI's influence on our media, insists that we must first ask ourselves a question: "How do jokes work?" Powell herself cut her teeth in improv comedy, a scene that is arguably more brutal still than the world of stand-up. In improv there is no room for planning, and the comedian has nothing but their instinctive response to an audience prompt.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">You might assume comedians have little to worry about if AI is so fundamentally derivative, but there are major secondary risks for creatives. "Comedians should be concerned about data theft and regurgitation, because many of the generative AI tools, especially ChatGPT, are being trained on content on the internet," Powell says. "This means people's writing and creativity are acquired from the internet without permission."</p>

            <caption class="width">AI v The Mind: Can AI tell better jokes than a human?</caption>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p class="h51 width">But pilfering jokes in itself isn't the only worry. As AI improves, so too might its ability to compete. "This would be a concern for a young comedian because if they get better at telling jokes, the models get better," she says.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">OpenAI has been mired in controversy for its alleged use of copyrighted content taken from behind paywalls to train its ChatGPT algorithms. Back in April, eight national US newspapers led by the New York Times <u><b>banded together to sue the company</b></u>, who they accused of "purloining millions" of dollars' worth of intellectual property. (OpenAI did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but the company maintains its processing of copywritten material constitutes fair use.)</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">"One way that AI can tell jokes is to do what any five-year-old does – repeat a successful joke that they have heard, or try to make an obvious variation of it," says Les Carr, a professor of web science at the University of Southampton, who dabbles in stand-up comedy in his spare time. "So, comedians – who have spent the last five years putting more and more of their content on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to gain a following – should be concerned about OpenAI and Google and Facebook stealing their work in the same way that authors and artists are."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">For Carr, a central concern is that AI will benefit from the way we tend to use the internet. "Jokes are something that people love to share on the internet or on social media, and so it is very difficult to say where a chatbot joke came from – did it make it up, or did it just repeat it off of '<u><b>/r/Jokes</b></u>' [a comedy forum] on Reddit?"</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="width h511">The jokes of the future</h3>
            <p class="h51 width">When Hobbs prompted the AI to generate the set for her, she ran into a strange problem. ChatGPT defaulted to writing in the voice of a male comedian – joking about impatience with its apparently shopping-obsessed girlfriend. When she asked the AI to rewrite the jokes in a female voice, it shifted the shopping-obsessed girlfriend to the first person.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">The gags ChatGPT produced for Hobbs lean into crude, lazy stereotypes around millennial women. "My social life, it's booming. If, by booming, you mean my best friend is a potted plant named Wilson," the AI wrote. The joke is clichéd one-liner, as the AI meshes the vague idea that young women enjoy pot plants alongside the odd reference to the Tom Hanks film Cast Away – with his volleyball friend "Wilson".</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">It's no surprise that these models struggle to deliver on satisfying builds and punchlines, says Michael Ryan, a masters student at a Stanford University AI expert who has researched AI's impact on comedy. "A well-done stand-up bit can lead the audience through a funny story all the way to a hilarious punchline," he says. "The whole time the comedian knew exactly where he or she was going with the joke and brought the audience there."</p>
            <p class="h51 width">ChatGPT and its brethren don't have the ability to process that kind of information. Unlike a human comedian, AI can't adapt in real time, at least not the AI tools currently available to the public. "This is not how modern LLMs work," Ryan says.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h51 width">However, that could change. Research is already ongoing to <u><b>give AI a greater understanding</b></u> of the world around it. "Researchers are already working to perfect audio capabilities AI models which will help with understanding social factors and being able to adapt to an audience, as well as with comedic timing," Ryan says.</p>
